Some code to help solve jigsaw puzzles in the real world

my hypothesis is that for normal jigsaws this should be possible without super accurate edge measurement and detection

instead using the same techniques humans use to solve jigsaws

piece type

relative lug position

corner angle

portrait v landscape

lug skew


ultimately take a picture of a real world jigsaw and the remaining pieces to fit and tell you which to put where

will need

piece detection from image

fit detection
